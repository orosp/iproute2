Compatibility
-------------
A new release of iproute2 is done with each kernel version, but
there is a wide range of compatibility. Newer versions of iproute2
will still work with older kernels, but there are some limitations.

If an iproute2 command with a new feature is used with an older
kernel, the kernel may report an error or silently ignore the new
attribute. Likewise if older iproute2 is used with an newer kernel,
it is not possible to use or see new features. The range of
compatibility extends back as far as the oldest supported Long Term
Support (LTS) kernel version.

How to compile this.
--------------------
1. libdbm

arpd needs to have the berkeleydb development libraries. For Debian
users this is the package with a name like libdbX.X-dev.
DBM_INCLUDE points to the directory with db_185.h which
is the include file used by arpd to get to the old format Berkeley
database routines.  Often this is in the db-devel package.

2. make

The makefile will automatically build a config.mk file which
contains definitions of libraries that may or may not be available
on the system such as: ATM, ELF, MNL, and SELINUX.

3. include/uapi

This package includes matching sanitized kernel headers because
the build environment may not have up to date versions. See Makefile
if you have special requirements and need to point at different
kernel include files.

4. YNL library (for dpll tool)

The dpll tool requires the YNL (YAML Netlink) library from the kernel
source tree. YNL is located at tools/net/ynl/ in the kernel sources.

To build dpll, you need kernel source:

    git clone https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
    cd iproute2
    ./configure --include_dir=/path/to/kernel/source/include
    make

If YNL is not found, the dpll tool will be skipped during build.
This is normal if you don't need dpll functionality.

Note: YNL is not yet packaged by distributions. Future versions may
support system-installed YNL library via pkg-config.

For detailed documentation, see dpll/README.md.
